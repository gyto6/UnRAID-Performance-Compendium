# unraid-zfs-docs
**A collection of documentation I've written up surrounding ZFS' use on UnRAID**

I've been using ZFS almost since it's arrival on the open source scene, starting back with the release of OpenSolaris back in late 2008, and using it as my filesystem of choice wherever possible ever since. I've been slowly documenting my setup as time's gone on, and as I was already doing so for myself, I thought it might be helpful to build it out a bit further in a form that could be referenced by others (if they so choose).
